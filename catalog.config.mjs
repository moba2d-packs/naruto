/**
 * What `@moba2d/core`'s catalogue generator needs to know about this pack's
 * layout — read by `moba2d-generate-spell-catalog --root=.`, which imports
 * this file's default export.
 *
 * It produces two generated files, both gitignored and both rebuilt by
 * `npm run catalog:generate`:
 *
 *   generated/spellCatalog.ts — every spell's name, description, icon key,
 *     cooldown and mana as **plain values**, so `pack.ts`'s data half can
 *     describe the roster without importing a single spell module. That is
 *     the whole reason this generator exists: a menu screen lists champions
 *     without loading the engine, and a spell module cannot even evaluate
 *     until `setPackApi` has run.
 *
 *   generated/spellModules.ts — `id -> () => import('../spells/X')`, so a
 *     match downloads the kits in play rather than all of them.
 *
 * `apiSetter` is how the generator hands this pack its engine before loading
 * the barrel: this pack's spells are ordinary class declarations
 * (`class X extends api.Spell`), so they read `api` the moment their module
 * evaluates, and loading the barrel is what evaluates them.
