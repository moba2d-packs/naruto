/**
 * The data half never reaches a spell module.
 *
 * Every class in `spells/` is an ordinary declaration against `packApi.ts`'s
 * `api`, which means it reads that api the moment its module evaluates. Three
 * callers set the api first — `pack.ts`'s code half, `vitest.setup.ts`, and
 * the catalogue generator — and each of them runs before anything reaches a
 * spell.
 *
 * A **static** import from the data half breaks that, and breaks it in the
 * one place with no way back: `data` is read before any api exists, by a menu
 * screen that has deliberately not loaded the engine. The failure is
 * `packApi.ts`'s proxy throwing at import time, which is legible but late —
 * it happens in a browser, after publish.
 *
 * The tempting version is `import { Q_COOLDOWN_MS } from './spells/Hero_Q'`
 * to fill `spellDisplay` without restating a number. That instinct is right
 * and the answer is `generated/spellCatalog.ts`: the generator constructs
 * each spell once at build time and writes its cooldown out as a plain value,
 * so the number still has exactly one source and the data half still imports
 * nothing.
 *
 * Dynamic `import('../spells/X')` is fine and is how `generated/
 * spellModules.ts` works — it happens when a match asks, long after the api
 * is set.
