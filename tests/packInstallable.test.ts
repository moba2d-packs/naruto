/**
 * This pack passes the check core runs before it installs anything.
 *
 * The one test here that is not about an ability, and the one that used to
 * be impossible to run: `validatePackData` is what stands between a pack and
 * `PackLoadError('shape', ...)`, and before it was reachable from a pack the
 * only place to meet it was a browser, after a deploy, as a red toast with
 * the pack already live at a URL. Every message it produces names a field
 * and a champion, and every one of them is a two-minute fix — but only if
 * you can see it here, in seconds, instead of there.
 *
 * It reads the data half only, which is the half a runtime install validates
 * before running any of this pack's code. The code half needs a real
 * `ContentApi`, which is what the ability tests beside this one build.
 *
 * Keep this file. Growing a pack is exactly what breaks it: a fifth ability
 * added to a champion's kit, a portrait left `null` on a new champion, a map
 * whose lanes name a faction it never declared.
