# Naruto

A `@moba2d/core` content pack: one champion (Hero) with a full kit,
one map, its own art path, and the build that publishes it — enough to
install into the game today and start growing from.

## Run this next

```
npm install
npm run verify
```

`verify` is typecheck + `check-seams` + tests + the published build, in that
order. It is **this pack's own gate**: `npm install` never runs it for you,
and core's own `verify` never reaches into a pack it does not own.

Once this pack is a git repository, `npm run hooks:install` points git at
`scripts/git-hooks/`, and from then on every `git push` runs `verify` first —
`git push --no-verify` skips it once, on purpose.

## Play it before you publish it

You do not need a copy of core. Serve your own build and install it into a
game that is already running somewhere:

```
npm run build
npm run serve      # -> http://localhost:5174/manifest.json
```

Paste that URL into the game's **Packs → Thêm bằng URL**. From then on
`npm run build` is the whole loop — core notices the new build and offers you
a reload, because a pack served from `localhost` is never pinned or cached.

Safari blocks `http://localhost` from an `https://` page; use Chrome or
Firefox, or put a tunnel in front of the port. `docs/PACK_AUTHORING.md` in
`@moba2d/core` has the long form.

## Publish it

`npm run build` writes `dist/`, and `dist/manifest.json` is the whole pack
behind one URL. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` does that on every push to
`main` and puts the result on GitHub Pages — turn Pages on once, by hand, at
**Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**, or every run fails at the
deploy step.

Players then install from:

```
https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/manifest.json
```

pasted into the game's **Tìm pack** field. Any static host that serves
`access-control-allow-origin: *` and a JavaScript MIME type for `.js` works
the same way; Pages does both.

## Where things live

- `pack.ts` — the whole pack's declaration, in two halves. `data` is inert
  (roster, map, display strings) and must be readable without an engine;
  `code` hands this pack its `api` and then a loader per spell.
- `spells/` — one file per ability, four to a champion, each an ordinary
  class: `export default class Hero_Q extends api.Spell { ... }`.
  Read `Hero_Q.ts` before writing a second one.
- `spells/index.ts` — the barrel. Adding a spell means adding one line here
  and one id to the champion's kit; everything else is generated.
- `AGENTS.md` — **read this before changing anything.** Recipes for adding,
  editing and removing an ability, a champion or a piece of art, each as a
  literal sequence of commands, plus the traps that cost real time and are
  invisible from the file you are editing. Written for a person or an agent
  with no prior context.
- `packApi.ts` — where the engine arrives. Its header is the one page worth
  reading twice: it says why a pack cannot `import { Spell }` at all, and
  which three callers set the api before any spell module evaluates.
- `assets/` — this pack's art. Drop a file in, run `npm run assets:generate`,
  and its key exists as a type. Ships one placeholder tile
  (`assets/champ_hero.png`) so the art path works before you have drawn
  anything; replace it.
- `tests/` — one per ability, plus `packInstallable` (core's own validator
  says yes to this pack) and `build` (what `dist/` actually emitted).
  **`npm run check-seams` scans `./spells`, and that is not an oversight**:
  the pack-core boundary is checked across the whole package either way — the
  run reports "scanned N file(s) of @moba2d/content-naruto" — while the
  per-tree rules it adds for `./tests` are about production code. `mana-spend`
  bans touching `stats.mana` outside `Spell.spendMana()`, which is exactly
  what a fixture building a champion has to do. Pointing it at `./tests` buys
  nothing and costs a debt file.
- `generated/` — gitignored, rebuilt by `prepare` after every install:
  `assetManifest.ts` (every file under `assets/`, keyed and typed),
  `spellCatalog.ts` (every spell's name, cooldown and mana as plain values,
  read off the class at build time) and `spellModules.ts` (the lazy
  `id -> import()` map). This is why the data half restates no number and
  imports no spell. **Never edit a file in here** — the next generate
  overwrites it, and `verify` fails when the two disagree.
- `tests/` — one test per ability, driven through `pressSpell`, never
  through a lifecycle hook like `onSpellCast()` directly: a hook-calling
  test cannot see activation, cooldown, resource cost or targeting
  rejection, and stays green against an ability that does not work at all.
  `packInstallable.test.ts` is the other kind — it runs core's own
  validator over this pack, so a change that would make the pack refuse to
  install fails here instead of in a player's browser.
- `map.ts` / `geometry.ts` — the world this pack ships. `geometry.ts` is
  fetched lazily, so a pregame picker never downloads the walls and lanes
  just to list this map's name.
- `catalog.config.mjs` — this pack's layout, as the catalogue generator
  needs it. `apiSetter` is the line that matters: it is how the generator
  hands this pack its engine before loading the barrel.
- `runtime-entry.ts` / `vite.config.ts` / `scripts/write-manifest.mjs` —
  the published build. Each carries its own header; `vite.config.ts`'s
  four settings are load-bearing and every one of them is a failure that
  has actually happened.

## Add a champion

By hand, in `pack.ts`, using Hero as the model — `moba2d-pack-add
champion` is not implemented and says so rather than pretending. Then fill
its four slots:

```
moba2d-pack-add spell <Name> --champion <NewChampion> --slot Q
```

which writes the spell file and its test, exports it from `spells/index.ts`
and adds its id to that champion's kit. There is no `spellDisplay` entry to
write: `npm run catalog:generate` reads the name, description, icon,
cooldown and mana off the class itself.
A **playable** champion needs a portrait and exactly four abilities — core
refuses to install anything else, and `tests/packInstallable.test.ts` is
what tells you before a player would.

## Next steps

- Make the four abilities different from each other. They ship as the same
  bolt four times on purpose: the shape is in place, the content is yours.
- Write real `description`s and artwork. Core's own `docs/VFX_STANDARD.md`
  is the whole bar in one page: a real windup, damage scaled to a ~100
  health pool, and as few layers as it takes to say what the ability does.
- Replace `geometry.ts` with a map worth playing on.
