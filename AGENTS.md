# Working on this pack

Recipes for changing `@moba2d/content-naruto`. Written to be followed
literally — by a person or by an agent — without reading the engine first.

`README.md` says what each file is. This says what to do.

The long form of everything here is `docs/PACK_AUTHORING.md` in the `@moba2d/core`
repository. This file was scaffolded from that repository's `scripts/templates/pack/AGENTS.md.tmpl`;
keep pack-specific notes in their own section at the bottom, so the generic half
stays diffable against the template.

**One rule above all the others:** run `npm run verify` before you say you are
done. It is `assets:check`, `catalog:check`, `typecheck`, `check-unused`,
`check-seams`, the build, and the tests. Every trap below is something it
catches; none of them are things you will notice by looking.

## Add an ability

```bash
npx moba2d-pack-add spell Firebolt --champion Hero --slot W
```

Writes `spells/Hero_W.ts` and `tests/Hero_W.test.ts`, and adds the export to
`spells/index.ts`. **That barrel line is the whole registration** — the
catalogue generator reads the barrel to write `generated/spellCatalog.ts` (the
name, cooldown and mana core's HUD reads) and `generated/spellModules.ts` (the
lazy `id -> import()` map the game loads from). One export reaches all three.

Then, by hand:

1. Put the id in the champion's kit in `pack.ts` — `spells: ['Hero_Q', …]`.
   A **playable** champion needs exactly four, in `Q W E R` order.
2. Write the ability. Start from the generated file; it extends
   `api.MissileSpellObject` and shows the shape.
3. Walk the VFX checklist below.
4. `npm run verify`.

### The VFX checklist, and why it is a checklist

Everything in it is already in core's `docs/VFX_STANDARD.md`. It is repeated
here because reading that document is **not** what stops these: every visual
failure the content packs have shipped was a rule its author had read that
week. The four a machine can hold are held by `tests/vfxRules.test.ts`, so
those reach you in `verify` rather than in a match. Below is the rest — the
ones no scan can judge, which is exactly why they need a person to stop and
answer them.

**Ask these before you write `draw()`:**

- **Three phases, and the third is the one you will skip.** Anticipation, the
  climax, then *dissipation*. Never `toRemove = true` on the frame an effect
  does its thing — deal the damage, mark it spent, let it leave. If one effect
  hands over to another, the two must **overlap**, or there is a frame with
  neither on screen and the hand-off reads as a pop.
- **Does the hit show on the victim?** Not near them — on them. A buff icon is
  not feedback; nobody reads the buff bar mid-fight.
- **Is this shape this champion's own?** A slab that blocks is somebody's
  wall; a pillar is somebody's pillar. If the answer is "well, it *is* a
  wall", the ability needs a different verb, not a different colour.
- **Would a stranger know where it hits?** Draw the real radius. If the front
  of the effect is deliberately ragged, put a thin rim on the true edge, or
  the player reads the longest spike as the reach and is wrong every time.
- **Is the drawn shape the same shape as the hitbox?** Not just the same
  *reach* — the same **area**. An arc swept through a sector damages
  everything inside the sector, so drawing only the bright line at the far
  edge is a picture that teaches the wrong ability: reported as "quét 1 line
  ... nhưng damage lại tính theo 1 hình quạt => user tưởng chỉ gây damage ở
  đường tròn". Fill the region the damage query really tests, and let the
  moving part ride on top of it. The test for this is mechanical: write down
  the shape the damage code checks — a circle, a sector, a capsule — and find
  it in `draw()`. If it is not there, the effect is lying about itself, and
  the player believes the effect.

**One shape rule worth writing down, because it has cost time three times:**
ridges, fingers, spikes — anything repeated — must be **rooted along a line
and pointed the same way**. Rooted at a point and fanned outward they read as
a mace, whatever they were meant to be. That is what turned an arm into a
club, an advancing wave into a hedgehog, and a grip into a gold starburst.

**Then look at it.** Two tools, and neither is optional for anything with a
shape in it:

- `node tools/preview-shape.mjs` renders geometry to an SVG in seconds. Use it
  **before** porting a shape into a spell. One ultimate took six rounds there
  and produced, in order, a biscuit, a Pac-Man, a hex nut and a hedgehog —
  not one of which was visible from the code.
- `npm run e2e:vfx` runs the ability in the **real renderer** and screenshots
  it at frames straddling the moments it changes. Add the ability to
  `tests/e2e/vfx-casts.json` — champion, slot, aim, and three frame times
  derived from the spell's own tuning constants — then open one or two PNGs.

  It needs a linked core checkout and a real Chrome, so it is deliberately
  **not** in `verify`. Run it once per ability with a shape, not per commit.
  Its first run on a finished, fully tested champion found that his ultimate
  rendered as a starburst: green build, 37 passing tests, invisible every
  other way.

## Change what an ability does

Edit `spells/<Champion>_<Slot>.ts` and its test together. Nothing else — the
numbers a player sees come off the class at build time, so `pack.ts` restates
none of them and neither does any doc.

**Export tuning values as constants** so the test imports them:

```ts
export const FIREBOLT_DAMAGE = 22;
```

Retuning damage must not mean editing a test.

## Remove an ability

1. Delete `spells/<Champion>_<Slot>.ts` and its test.
2. Delete its line from `spells/index.ts`.
3. Delete its id from the champion's `spells` array in `pack.ts`.
4. `npm run verify` — `catalog:check` fails if you missed step 2, and
   `packInstallable` fails if a playable champion is left with three abilities.

## Add a champion

No generator for this one yet. By hand:

1. Four abilities, as above.
2. A portrait: drop `assets/champ_<name>.png` in and run
   `npm run assets:generate`. The key is the path under `assets/` without the
   extension, so that file is `champ_<name>` — and stays `champ_<name>` when
   the build re-encodes it to WebP.
3. A row in `pack.ts`'s `champions`, with `playable: true`, the `image` key
   from step 2, an `attack` profile, and the four ids.

Core refuses to install a playable champion with no portrait or without
exactly four abilities, and says which one is wrong.

## Remove a champion

Delete its four spell files and tests, its four lines from `spells/index.ts`,
its row from `pack.ts`, and its art from `assets/`. Then
`npm run assets:generate && npm run verify`.

## Add an item

An item's `passive` and `active` are **ordinary spells**, from the same barrel a
champion's abilities come from. That is the whole mechanism; the rest is what
keeps one from also behaving like an ability.

1. Write `spells/Item_<Name>.ts` and its test, and export it from
   `spells/index.ts` — same as any spell. `manaCost = 0`, and a passive has
   `coolDown = 0` too.
2. The icon: art under `assets/`, then `npm run assets:generate`.
3. A row in `pack.ts`'s item entries: `id`, `name`, `icon`, `cost`, an optional
   `stats` (allow-listed keys only — see `ItemStatKey`), optional `buildsFrom`,
   and `passive`/`active` naming the local spell ids.
4. `npm run verify`.

**`cost` is the total, written once.** What a player pays when the parts are
already in the bag is `cost` minus the parts, worked out by core's
`ItemShop.priceFor`. A separate combine cost is the same fact in two places, and
they drift on the first retune. Core refuses a total under the sum of its parts.

## Add art

Drop the file under `assets/` and run `npm run assets:generate`. Its key now
exists as a type, so `api.asset('champ_hero')` is checked and a typo is a
compile error rather than a blank square in a match.

Use **this pack's own keys**, never one of core's. `check-seams` enforces it:
reusing a key that happens to exist in core's art is a pack that draws the
engine's pictures.

## Publish

```bash
git push
```

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` builds and deploys to GitHub Pages on every
push to the default branch. Players install from
`https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/manifest.json`.

Nothing to bump by hand. `scripts/write-manifest.mjs` derives `buildId` from
the file list, core hangs it off the entry URL, and a player whose installed
copy is older is offered the update.

## Traps

Each of these has cost real time, and none is visible from the file you are
editing.

**Never `import { Spell } from '@moba2d/core'`.** Not once, not in a test.
The pack builds with core marked `external` and publishes its own `pack.js`,
which a browser `import()`s from another origin — a surviving value import is
a bare specifier nothing resolves. The engine *arrives* instead, through
`packApi.ts`: `export default class Firebolt extends api.Spell {}`. `import
type` is fine; the compiler erases it.

**`generated/` is written, not authored.** Editing a file in there is undone
by the next `assets:generate` or `catalog:generate`, both of which `prepare`
runs after every install, and `verify` fails when the two disagree.

**A `UNIT` spell must declare `targetingRequest: { targetTeam: 'ENEMY' }`.**
Omit it and targeting defaults to `'ANY'`, which includes the caster — with
the cursor on empty ground the nearest-target fallback resolves *her*, and the
spell dashes to and damages its own caster. Four abilities shipped that way in
the largest pack there is before anyone noticed.

**Spend mana through `spendMana()` and read range through `Reach`.** Touching
`stats.mana` directly opts out of the match rules that make URF work;
`check-seams` bans the name from `spells/`.

**Art keys strip the extension.** `assets/champ_hero.png` and
`assets/champ_hero.webp` are the same key, which is what lets the build
re-encode art without touching a line of code — and also means two files with
the same stem are a duplicate-key error.

**Ship art as files, not as data URIs.** `vite.config.ts` sets
`assetsInlineLimit: 0` on purpose: `pack.js` is downloaded before the menu can
draw, and inlined art puts every champion's portrait in it to play a match
that needs four.

**Label your damage.** `takeDamage(amount, this.owner, 'MAGIC', 'Tên Chiêu')`
— the third argument is the damage type (`'PHYSICAL' | 'MAGIC' | 'TRUE'`), the
fourth the player-facing source label. Core's death-recap modal groups what
killed a player by that label; damage dealt without one shows up as
"Không rõ". A test spying on `takeDamage` should match the trailing arguments
with `expect.any(String)` (or `.slice(0, 2)` the call), not restate them.

**A re-applied Slow must `RENEW_EXISTING`.** `Slow`'s default add type stacks
(ten deep), so a zone or aura that re-applies its slow every tick turns "40%
slow" into a standstill. The aura pattern is one slow whose clock is rewound:

```ts
const slow = new Slow(400, this.owner, enemy);
slow.percent = 0.4;
slow.buffAddType = api.enums.BuffAddType.RENEW_EXISTING;
enemy.addBuff(slow);
```

**Never put an item's spell id in a champion's `spells: [...]`.** That would be
one spell wearing two prices — an ability a champion casts for free and an item
the shop charges for.

**An item's spell must stay out of `spellDisplay`.** That map is what a loadout
screen offers as a *choosable ability*, so an item's active left in it gets
handed to a player who never bought the item. Skip anything named `Item_*` by
prefix in `displayData()`; do not replace the check with a list — the next item
is the one that gets left off it.

**A pack with items has to declare a `coreRange` floor.** `items` did not exist
in `ContentPackData` before core 1.3, `buildsFrom` before 1.4, and
`Buff.hudVisible`/`Buff.sourceSpell` before 1.5. An older core does not fail on
any of them — it *ignores* what it does not know, and installs a shop whose
passives never come off when sold. `pack.ts` and `scripts/write-manifest.mjs`
state that floor separately and must move together.

**Use `Dash.onDashUpdate`, never `dashBuff.onUpdate = …`.** `Dash` puts the
movement itself in `Dash.prototype.onUpdate`, so an instance assignment replaces
the frame instead of hooking it and the champion plays the spell's logic standing
still. It reads exactly like a callback, which is why three abilities shipped
with it unnoticed — each still dealt its damage to whatever was next to the
caster. `check-seams` scans for it.

**A bookkeeping buff hides itself.** An item passive or an internal state
tracker sets `buff.hudVisible = false`, or every purchase adds a row to the
player's buff bar. `duration = 0` means permanent and draws no countdown;
a permanent buff with a nonzero duration draws a negative one.

**`interrupts:` — only `SpellForm.CHANNELED` breaks on the caster's own
movement.** `AIMED`, `HELD` and `TETHERED` all survive moving and Flash and
break only on death, stun or silence — that is what keeps cast-then-Flash
combos playable. Reserve `CHANNELED` for a true channel (a Recall-like),
because it also breaks on displacement.

**"Player is not available in this test context" is usually not the error.**
Vitest's failure printer walks the test game object and trips its throwing
`player` getter while serialising an ordinary assertion diff. The real
failure is the assertion above it — read the whole message before touching
the fixture.

**A gitignored lockfile still pins.** `package-lock.json` is untracked but
real on disk: `npm install` resolves `@moba2d/core`'s git dependency to
whatever commit the *local* lockfile recorded, however old. To actually pick
up core's current `#main`, run `npm update @moba2d/core`. CI never has the
lockfile, so it resolves fresh every run — the drift only ever shows up
locally.

**`npm install` (and any `bun install`) stomps a dev link.** While this pack
is linked to a local core checkout (`npm run pack:link` from core), an install
here silently replaces the symlink with the registry copy and every new-API
line stops compiling. `scripts/check-core-link.mjs` (first step of `verify`,
warn-only on `postinstall`) is what tells you; `npm run pack:link` from core
is the repair.

**Install the git hooks once per clone:** `npm run hooks:install`. The
pre-push hook runs `npm run verify`; `git push --no-verify` or
`MOBA2D_SKIP_VERIFY=1 git push` skips it once, deliberately.
