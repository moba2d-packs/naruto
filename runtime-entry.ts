/**
 * The entry a runtime install imports — this whole pack behind one URL.
 *
 * `dist/manifest.json`'s `entry` field points at the build of this file, and
 * core's `loadPackFromManifest` reads three things off the module it gets
 * back: `default` (the uninvoked code-half factory — the call that hands this
 * pack its api), `data` (the half it
 * validates before any of this pack's code runs) and `assetManifest`
 * (optional; core registers it under this pack's id). Anything else exported
 * here is ignored, and a missing `default` or `data` is a load error the
 * player meets as "pack không tải được".
 *
 * It re-exports rather than declaring: core's build-time path reads
 * `<pkg>/pack` and `<pkg>/generated/assetManifest` separately, and keeping this file a
 * pure re-export is what stops the two paths from drifting into two
 * different packs.
