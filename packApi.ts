/**
 * The engine, handed to this pack once and readable from module scope.
 *
 * A pack may not value-import core. That is not a style rule: this pack is
 * built with `@moba2d/core` marked `external`, published as its own `pack.js`,
 * and `import()`ed cross-origin by a browser — an `import { Spell } from
 * '@moba2d/core'` surviving into that file is a bare specifier nothing can
 * resolve. The engine has to *arrive*, and this module is where it arrives.
 *
 * It arrives before any spell module evaluates, which is what lets a spell be
 * an ordinary class declaration:
 *
 *     import { api } from '../packApi';
 *     export default class Hero_Q extends api.Spell { ... }
 *
 * rather than a factory that has to be called, memoized per api, and unwrapped
 * again to name its own instance type. ES modules evaluate once, so the class
 * above *is* one class for the life of the page — which is the property a
 * hand-rolled `WeakMap<ContentApi, ...>` memo was there to buy.
 *
 * Three callers set it, and there are only three:
 *
 *   - `pack.ts`'s code half, for the real game and for a runtime install;
 *   - `vitest.setup.ts`, before any test file is imported;
 *   - `catalog.config.mjs`'s `apiSetter`, so the catalogue generator can
 *     construct a spell to read its display fields.
 *
 * **The data half must never reach a spell module.** `pack.ts` reads names,
 * icons and cooldowns out of `generated/spellCatalog.ts` — plain values — for
 * exactly this reason: a menu screen lists a roster without loading the
 * engine, and a static import of a spell from the data half would evaluate a
 * class before any of the three callers above had run. `tests/dataHalf.test.ts`
 * is what keeps that true.
